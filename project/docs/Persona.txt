### Persona
Pain：
1. Spending 45+ minutes on complex applications just to find a hidden risk factor
2. Pressure to hit weekly targets while keeping defaults under 4%
3. Getting blamed for “obvious misses” in hindsight during quarterly reviews
4. Juggling gut feeling with outdated risk rules that miss modern borrower patterns

Key Decisions Can Makes:
“Approve with conditions” (e.g., require co-signer) vs straight approve/reject
Whether to escalate to the lending manager for exceptions
How to explain denials to frustrated applicants fairly and clearly

How the Model Help:
Gives a clear, data-backed risk score in <30 secs
Flags non-obvious risks (e.g., rapid recent credit inquiries + high debt-to-income)
Lets people focus on deep experience on edge cases, not routine screening
