    "Model deployment and monitoring was the most challenging stage. Creating robust error handling for the Flask API required careful consideration of edge cases and failure modes. Designing meaningful monitoring metrics across data, model, system, and business layers was difficult because it required anticipating potential failure points before they occur. Setting realistic thresholds for alerts that balance sensitivity without creating alert fatigue was particularly tough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which part of your repo is most reusable in a future project?\n",
    "The project structure and orchestration framework is the most reusable component. The organized folder layout with separate data, notebooks, src, and model directories provides a scalable template. The Flask API implementation with standardized error handling and the model persistence pattern can be easily adapted. The monitoring dashboard design and logging infrastructure are also highly transferable to other ML projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a teammate had to pick up your repo tomorrow, what would help them most?\n",
    "The comprehensive README with clear setup instructions and the well-documented API endpoints would be most helpful. The example notebook showing complete workflow from data loading to model deployment provides a quick onboarding path. The requirements.txt file ensures environment reproducibility, and the organized project structure makes navigation intuitive. The error handling examples and monitoring documentation would help them understand failure scenarios and maintenance procedures quickly."
